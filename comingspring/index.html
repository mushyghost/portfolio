            <p>This game is a role-playing game. And its status is still in progress.</p>
<h3 id="Synopsis"><a href="#Synopsis" class="headerlink" title="Synopsis"></a>Synopsis</h3><p>There was a land where fantasy came. It’s called The Spring Fantasy. Residents of that land were the unusual creature and also unusual nature and world, and they are all magnificent. This land led by a king, his name is King Lavish. And this land lives in happy ever after.</p>
<p>Someday, a dark sky covered this land, with the huge wind just like sky wants to fall its rain. All creatures felt fear, run in and hide in their house. The King Lavish looked at the sky of dark, and he noticed that that dark sky isn’t a natural phenomenon, but it is a curse that must be a somebody released it. The Dark Sky started to fall it’s rain and showed lighting and thunders. And it made natural disaster all over the land. Not only just a disaster, but the disaster also made monsters of elements from its damage. Monsters attacked this land residents and made chaos all over the land.</p>
<p>King Lavish exerted all his army to fight against those monsters. All day of this land were chaos and fights. Residents all filled with fear and horror. And people started to call those monsters with Melancholy of Elements.</p>
<p>All of the efforts failed, the king’s advisor asked The King Lavish to meet The Legendary Creature of The Holy Pond of The North. And the king accepted that advice. Before he leaves, the King gave an order to his advisor to take care of the old house in The Tacit Forest of The Middle, and lend his control of his kingdom to the kingdom’s prime minister.</p>
<p>King Lavish went into The Holy Pond of The North in order to meet The Legendary Creature. He met The Legendary Creature and told him about all of The Spring Fantasy’s conditions. The Legendary Creature asked The King Lavish to meditate near The Holy Pond of The North. And after long years, fate comes to The Spring Fantasy.</p>
<h3 id="Mechanism"><a href="#Mechanism" class="headerlink" title="Mechanism"></a>Mechanism</h3><h4 id="In-Progress"><a href="#In-Progress" class="headerlink" title="In Progress"></a>In Progress</h4><p>Main Story is in progress, the finished story is the demo story. Recent mechanism progress is a bunch of nodes to handle interaction of the world, such as dialogue, emotion visualization, rewards, and answer-question statement. Story sequence management to handle the main story and DLC stories have been finished, but those still need to be polished. Basic buff and skills in combat have been finished but still need to be polished. Basic motion has been finished. Post-processing and layouts are also in progress.</p>
<h4 id="Design-Plans"><a href="#Design-Plans" class="headerlink" title="Design Plans"></a>Design Plans</h4><p>Recently, there are several designs has been added to the job list. Those are,</p>
<h5 id="Characters"><a href="#Characters" class="headerlink" title="Characters"></a>Characters</h5><p>Several main characters have been finished. Characters that still in progress and conceptions are enemies, and secondary characters. We mainly pick chibi and cute character concept as the main reference.</p>
<h5 id="Levels"><a href="#Levels" class="headerlink" title="Levels"></a>Levels</h5><p>Levels that have been finished are the levels of the first chapter. Yet, the others are still in concept and we try as best as we can to match the levels to the main story feels. Mainly, we stick with blocky terrains to create our levels.</p>
<h5 id="Currency-Mechanics"><a href="#Currency-Mechanics" class="headerlink" title="Currency Mechanics"></a>Currency Mechanics</h5><p>We are still working on the currencies system in the game. Of course, classic RPG systems such as EXP will be considered. So far, we want to put the crafting system and the gacha (roll base on luck) system to the game.</p>
<h5 id="Battle-Mechanics"><a href="#Battle-Mechanics" class="headerlink" title="Battle Mechanics"></a>Battle Mechanics</h5><p>The combat of the game is limited to attack cards. The main idea of combat is there are several cards and then those are shuffled and the player can select several of shuffled cards. The player attacks based on cards that had been selected. And cards are unique to its ability and skills.</p>
<p>The basic system such as buff and skills can be used in combat, and demerits such as debuff are in the game too. And we have finished these systems and we are still polishing it.</p>
<p>The combat begins when the player approaches an enemy. The world and the combat battle are separated. Effects in combat such as health decreased will remain after combat, means these effects remain in the world.</p>
<p>When the player dead, recently we set a concept that EXP will be decreased.</p>
